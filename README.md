# Hackers

## Hacker News reading app for iPhone

Hackers is an iPhone app for reading Hacker News on the go. It's optimised for quickly catching up on the latest news and comments without getting in your way.

## Features

* Comments replies are collapsed, leaving you to decide whether you want to read the replies without them getting in the way.
* Remembers which posts you've read.
* Filter by top news, new news, or Ask HN.
* Instapaper mobilizer support.
